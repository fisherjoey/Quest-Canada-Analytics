QUEST CANADA WEB APP - PLANNING QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Please answer these questions to clarify your goals and requirements for the
new React/Node/PostgreSQL web application. This will help us create a concrete
implementation plan.

================================================================================
SECTION 1: ARCHITECTURE & INTEGRATION
================================================================================

1. FLASK API MIGRATION
   Do you want to:
   [X] Port your existing Flask API to Node/Express (complete rewrite)
   [ ] Keep Flask as a microservice alongside the new Node backend
   [ ] Other (explain):

   Your answer:


   Follow-up: Your current Flask API has ~20 endpoints. How much of this logic
   needs to be in the new web app vs. just used by Grafana?

   Your answer: I'm not too stressed if we have to restart completely. I don't remember what endpoints are in there. It's likely form stuff that we'd remake completely anyways.


2. DATABASE STRATEGY
   [ ] Keep existing PostgreSQL database and schema (extend with new tables)
   [X] Start fresh with a new database for the web app
   [ ] Have two separate databases (one for Grafana, one for web app)
   [ ] Other (explain):

   Your answer:


   If keeping existing: Should the web app share the same database as Grafana,
   or have a separate database with API connections between them?

   Your answer: N/A


3. GRAFANA DASHBOARD EMBEDDING
   Embedding approach:
   [ ] iframe embedding (simple but limited customization)
   [ ] Grafana anonymous/public dashboards feature
   [ ] Grafana API with custom rendering
   [ ] Other (explain): 

   Your answer: Not sure. Whatever is best practice.


   Do users need to interact with the dashboards (filters, dropdowns) or just
   view them? 

   Your answer: Yes, interaction will be necessary. 


   Should dashboard access be controlled by your web app's authentication, or
   keep Grafana's auth separate?

   Your answer: Through web app's authentication. We could do this through nginx or apache maybe?


================================================================================
SECTION 2: AUTHENTICATION & USER MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

4. USER ACCOUNTS & MULTI-TENANCY
   Do you need multi-tenancy (multiple organizations/communities with isolated
   data)?
   [ ] Yes, each community should only see their own data
   [ ] No, single organization with different user roles
   [ ] Not sure yet

   Your answer: Not yet. If it's easy, that would be a nice start though


   Authentication methods needed:
   [X] Email/password only
   [ ] Social auth (Google, GitHub, etc.)
   [ ] Both
   [ ] Other (explain):

   Your answer:


   User roles needed (check all that apply):
   [X] Admin (full access to everything)
   [X] Community Staff (manage their community's data)
   [X] Funders (view-only access to funded projects)
   [X] Public Viewers (anonymous/public dashboards)
   [ ] Other (specify):

   Your answer:


================================================================================
SECTION 3: FEATURES & FUNCTIONALITY
================================================================================

5. CORE FEATURES
   Data entry forms: Will users enter assessment/project data through the web
   app, or continue using Grafana forms?
   [X] Move all forms to the web app (React forms)
   [ ] Keep forms in Grafana for now
   [ ] Hybrid approach (some in web app, some in Grafana)

   Your answer: 


   PDF export feature: Should this move from Grafana to the web app?
   [X] Yes, implement in web app
   [ ] No, keep in Grafana
   [ ] Not sure yet

   Your answer: We'll be adding a lot more features to the report export. This will be in the app.


   Project management: Should project/funding/milestone tracking be in the web
   app or stay in Grafana dashboards?
   [ ] Move to web app (full CRUD interface)
   [ ] Keep in Grafana
   [ ] View in web app, edit in Grafana

   Your answer: Whatever is best. I'm not sure.


6. PRIORITY FEATURES (PHASE 1 MVP)
   What's the minimum viable product feature list for the web app?
   Check your priorities for Phase 1:

   [X] User authentication & login
   [X] User registration/signup
   [X] Dashboard to view embedded Grafana charts
   [X] Data entry forms for assessments
   [X] Data entry forms for projects/funding/milestones
   [X] User management (invite users, assign roles)
   [X] Community/organization management (multi-tenancy)
   [X] Admin panel
   [X] PDF report generation
   [ ] Email notifications
   [ ] API for external integrations
   [X] Mobile-responsive design
   [ ] Other (specify):

   Your top 3-5 must-haves for Phase 1: You decide. We're past the MVP phase. We're down to full implentation. 

================================================================================
SECTION 4: DEPLOYMENT & TIMELINE
================================================================================

7. HOSTING STRATEGY
   Where will you deploy the web app?
   [X] Keep on Proxmox LXC container (current: LXC 101 at 10.0.0.3)
   [ ] Move to cloud (Vercel for frontend, Railway/Render for backend)
   [ ] Docker containers on Proxmox
   [ ] Other (explain):

   Your answer:


   Do you want Docker containers for easier deployment?
   [ ] Yes, Dockerize everything
   [] No, keep it simple
   [X] Not sure yet

   Your answer:


8. TIMELINE & SCOPE
   When do you need this working?
   [ ] ASAP (within 1-2 weeks)
   [X] Within a month
   [ ] Within 2-3 months
   [ ] No rush, personal project timeline
   [ ] Other (specify):

   Your answer:


   Is this replacing the Grafana system entirely, or running alongside it
   initially?
   [ ] Replace Grafana entirely
   [ ] Run alongside Grafana initially (hybrid approach)
   [ ] Grafana stays permanently (only for dashboards)

   Your answer: Not sure. If there's a library that replaces the functionality that's fine



   What's "good enough" for a first version vs. nice-to-have later?

   Your answer (explain your MVP definition):


================================================================================
SECTION 5: DATA MIGRATION
================================================================================

9. EXISTING DATA
   Your current system has:
   - 3 communities (Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver)
   - 15 projects with standardized codes
   - 3 benchmark assessments with scores
   - 50 milestones
   - 34 funding entries

   Do you need to migrate/preserve this data?
   [ ] Yes, migrate all existing data to new system
   [X] No, start fresh with demo/test data
   [ ] Migrate some (specify which):

   Your answer:


   If migrating: Should we write scripts to move data from current schema to
   the new boilerplate's schema?
   [ ] Yes, automate the migration
   [ ] No, I'll manually re-enter important data
   [ ] Not sure yet

   Your answer: n/a


================================================================================
SECTION 6: SAAS BOILERPLATE CHOICE
================================================================================

10. BOILERPLATE PREFERENCE
    Based on the research, which starter template sounds best to you?

    [X] Open SaaS (Wasp) - React/Node/PostgreSQL/TypeScript, fully featured
    [ ] Graphile Starter - React/Node/PostgreSQL/GraphQL, PostgreSQL-first
    [ ] BoxyHQ SaaS Starter - Next.js/React/PostgreSQL, enterprise features
    [ ] Start from scratch (no boilerplate)
    [ ] Not sure, need more info

    Your answer:


    Why did you choose this option?

    Your answer: fastest?


================================================================================
SECTION 7: ADDITIONAL CONTEXT
================================================================================

11. ANYTHING ELSE?
    Any other requirements, concerns, or preferences we should know about?

    Your answer:


12. BIGGEST PAIN POINT
    What's the single biggest problem with the current Grafana-only setup that
    you want the new web app to solve?

    Your answer: Lack of customizability.
